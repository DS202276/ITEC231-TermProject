            <p class="justified">Film censorship in Canada has a long and complex history, reflecting societal values and political influences. Several governmental organizations, including the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and provincial film boards, were heavily involved in the 20th century's film censorship of movies that were judged offensive or unacceptable to public morals. One of the key turning points in the history of film censorship was the creation of the Ontario Censor Board in 1911, which was for national regulations of film content. </p><br>

<p>Over time, the creation of rating systems, like the Canadian Film Classification Board, became more important than outright censorship. To assist viewers in making educated choices about what to watch, this board changed the focus to offering age-based ratings and details about the content of movies. In Canada, the classification of films remains mandatory. The country continues to enforce a system where films must undergo classification by government bodies. Compared to the USA film rating system, Canada is considered more  tolerant. This evolution shows us how Canadians were trying to balance artistic expression and some social norms in films.</p>
